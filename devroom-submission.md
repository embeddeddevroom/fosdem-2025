# Project details
## Title of devroom

Embedded, Mobile and Automotive

## Elaborate description of proposed devroom (including possible topics)

The Embedded, Mobile and Automotive Devroom aims at gathering
developers interested in open-source hardware or open-source software
in embedded systems in the broadest possible sense: industrial,
automotive, mobile, etc. Its main goal is to showcase open source
projects and allow people to share their experience, exchange
knowledge and foster open collaboration.

Possible topics include:
* Open-source hardware
* Open-source operating systems for embedded
* Linux kernel support for embedded
* Firmware and bootloaders in embedded systems
* Open-source software stacks for embedded use cases

## Why does it fit FOSDEM?

The Embedded, Mobile and Automotive industries heavily depend on
FOSS. There are so many related open source projects that it is almost
impossible to know them all. That's why we believe that knowledge
sharing is a main goal of this devroom.

The Embedded, Mobile and Automotive Devroom has been present for many
years at FOSDEM, each year gathering a significant audience, showing
the interest of the open-source community in this topic.
