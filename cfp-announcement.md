This email is a Call For Participation in the Embedded, Mobile and
Automotive Devroom at FOSDEM 2025.


Devroom date: February 1st 2025 in Brussels, Belgium
CFP deadline: Friday, December 1st 2024.

Final speaker confirmation on Friday, December 15th 2024.


CFP Introduction
---------------------------

Embedded software is transforming the world, and FOSS embedded software
is leading the way. From automotive to the Internet of Things,
launching rockets, messing with your phone or automating your toaster,
small devices, embedded systems, and automatons are everywhere.
Join in and tell the world about your project!

This year we welcome talks that are either:
* 10 min (short introduction of project/topic)
* 25 min (normal slot)
* 50 min (extraordinary slot for a topic that needs a deeper explanation)

Topics Sought
------------------------

The embedded devroom seeks topics related to automotive, industrial,
mobile, consumer electronics, autonomous and generally embedded
systems, either from a professional or hobbyist background. Topics
such as operating systems (Linux, Zephyr, NuttX, FreeRTOS), hardware
platforms (from microcontrollers to microprocessors, FPGAs) and
software stacks are welcome. Related areas are of course of interest
as well and our definition of "embedded" is elastic.

CFP Schedule And Submission Details
-----------------------------------------------------------

Please submit proposals no later than the 1st of December. Please note
that this year submission deadline is mandated by the FOSDEM orgs and
we may not be able to accommodate any latecomers.

Please use the following URL to submit your talk to FOSDEM 2025:

https://fosdem.org/submit

and follow the following rules:

     * This year FOSDEM keeps using the new CFP system - pretalx.
       Pentabarf (old system < 2023) accounts have not been migrated
       so you need to create a new one

     * Select as the Track "Embedded, mobile and automotive devroom"

     * Include a title and an abstract please be concise, but clear
       and descriptive. Optionally you can clarify your abstract in
       the description field and provide remarks to organizers in
       the Submission Notes.

     * Indicate whether you seek a 10, 25, or 50 minute slot.

     * Specify additional speaker email (if any). The co-speaker will
       need to create an account in order to be visible on the agenda.

     * Use the "Links" sub-area to your past work in the field you'd
       like to share.

     * This year you will need to also state the OSI-approved license
       of the subject of your talk. Although this is the mandatory
       requirement, we still invite talks about:
       "Reverse engineering ...", "Hacking ...", "What's inside ..."
       even if the code does not exist yet. If any doubts arrise don't
       hesitate to contact us.

     * Last but not least, make sure you have up to date contact info.

Feel free to send an email to the embedded mailing list should you have
any questions with the conference system.
